# Book-Recommendation-System
This project uses datasets that are heavily based on the ones provided on UCSD Book Graph (https://sites.google.com/eng.ucsd.edu/ucsdbookgraph/) to build a book recommendation system that recommends books to users based on their preference data as well as their past reading activities, if any. This project was initially developed as a graded component to fulfill the course requirement of CSC111 at University of Toronto, St. George Campus. This is the result of the collaborative efforts of Jayden Chiola-Nakai, Maria Ma, Kaiwen Zheng, and Shaqeel Hazmi Bin Radzifuddin, who were then students of CSC111.
